You are in the parking lot of Pokagon Park.
There are few cars in the parking lot. But it
looks like some vandels have broken into many
of the cars. You park and lock your doors after
getting out to investigate the glow. The Potawatomi
Inn is to the south, there are two trail heads to the 
east and north, and the Gatehouse is to the west.
