You are at the Potawatomi Inn.
Many people are crowded inside the building
enjoying Cupcakes. As someone offers you one
you hear whispers of zombies in the area
and a scientist says he can stop the outbreak
of zombies if someone can gather the ingredients.
He requires: a vial of liquid, spring water, a
powder, and an aerosol can to dispense it. It is
up to you to save the world!! The parking lot is to 
the north. The boat rentals are to the south, and the
volleyball nets are to the west.
